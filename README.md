ScoreBoard
==========

A Django server to provide highscores/replays/custom level functionality for something I'm working on

For production, in the settings file, Debug should be turned off and ALLOWED_HOSTS updated to contain '.almostmatt.com'

To be visible to flash games running on other websites, the following crossdomain.xml needs to exist
This can be generated by django-flashpolicies if django handles the site.com/crossdomain.xml url, or in the base site public_html
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy
  SYSTEM 'http://www.adobe.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd'>
<cross-domain-policy>
	<allow-access-from domain="*"/>
</cross-domain-policy>
