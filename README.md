ScoreBoard
==========

A Django server to provide highscores/replays/custom level functionality for something I'm working on

For production, values in config.py can/should be changed

Additionally, python manage.py syncdb and python manage.py collectstatic need to be run

To be visible to flash games running on other websites, the following crossdomain.xml needs to exist
This can be generated by django-flashpolicies if django handles the site.com/crossdomain.xml url, or in the base site public_html

```<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy
  SYSTEM 'http://www.adobe.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd'>
<cross-domain-policy>
	<allow-access-from domain="*"/>
</cross-domain-policy>```
